## 2024-06-18 - [Notification Engine O(N*M) lookups]
**Learning:** Found an O(N*M) lookup pattern in `runNotificationEngine` where `Array.prototype.some()` is used to check for existing notification keys while iterating over posts and tasks.
**Action:** Always pre-compute a `Set` of existing keys before iterating over collections to achieve O(1) lookups, changing the complexity to O(N+M).
