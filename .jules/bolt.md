## 2024-06-18 - [Notification Engine O(N*M) lookups]
**Learning:** Found an O(N*M) lookup pattern in `runNotificationEngine` where `Array.prototype.some()` is used to check for existing notification keys while iterating over posts and tasks.
**Action:** Always pre-compute a `Set` of existing keys before iterating over collections to achieve O(1) lookups, changing the complexity to O(N+M).

## 2024-06-19 - [DOM Layout Thrashing in List Rendering]
**Learning:** The `renderCalendar` function was appending `div` elements directly to the live DOM (`calendarGrid.appendChild()`) inside a loop that runs ~35 times per render. This causes the browser to recalculate layout repeatedly (layout thrashing), which is a significant performance bottleneck in list rendering.
**Action:** Always use a `DocumentFragment` to batch DOM insertions when rendering lists. Append elements to the fragment in the loop, then append the fragment to the DOM once at the end.

## 2024-06-20 - [Redundant Iterations in Statistics Calculation]
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in `updateStats` where `.filter().length` was called three times on the `posts` array to calculate different metrics (`statCompleted`, `statInProgress`, `statOutOfScheduled`). This resulted in O(3N) time complexity and unnecessary allocation of intermediate arrays for each calculation.
**Action:** Always combine multiple counting or filtering logic into a single-pass loop (e.g., `for...of` or `.reduce()`) when deriving multiple metrics from the same array. This changes the complexity to O(N) and eliminates garbage collection overhead from temporary array creation.

## 2024-06-21 - [Date Instantiations and Multi-pass Arrays in Stats]
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in `renderPostStatsChart` where `.filter` and `.forEach` were used to traverse the same `posts` array multiple times, while repetitively instantiating `new Date()` within the loop (even instantiating `new Date()` twice per post). This resulted in redundant parsing overhead and higher time complexity.
**Action:** Always calculate multiple metrics from a single source array using a single-pass `for...of` loop or `.reduce()`. Cache values that don't change per item (like `new Date()` for current time) outside the loop to minimize redundant object instantiations and parsing.

## 2026-03-21 - [O(K*N) Complexity in Nested UI Filtering]
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in `renderPosts` where `filteredPosts.filter()` was repeatedly called inside a `forEach` loop iterating over the days of the week, resulting in an O(K*N) time complexity and redundant parsing overhead for Date objects.
**Action:** Always pre-group categorized data (such as items separated by day or type) into a hash map in a single O(N) pass rather than repeatedly calling array `.filter()` within a render loop, replacing the inner O(N) traversal with an O(1) hash map lookup.
